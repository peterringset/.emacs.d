# .emacs.d

**My .emacs.d - use it, break it, fix it, trash it**

This emacs configuration is tested in emacs 25.1 on macOS. Some of the configurations aren't compatible with Windows, yet.

## Usage

Clone this into your home folder as `.emacs.d`. Rember to backup your old `.emacs.d` if you already have one:

```
git clone https://github.com/tmn/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```

## Dependencies

Install system dependencies for some of the emacs packages.

### macOS

```bash
brew install the_silver_searcher
```

### Linux (apt)

```bash
apt-get install silversearcher-ag
```

Cheers!
